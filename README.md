# Type Error in TypeScript
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and how to fix it.

The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return their sum.  However, the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument. TypeScript correctly flags this as an error because of type mismatch.

The solution shows how to address this error using type guards or type assertions, depending on the desired level of type safety and runtime flexibility.
